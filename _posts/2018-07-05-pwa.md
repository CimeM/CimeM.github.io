Websites are not what they used to be anymore. To win the hearts and minds of your users you have to have a Progressive Web App.

With a few simple updates, the website can look (and behave) as an app. Its the matter of few updates. These websites behave like apps on smartphones, tablets and also laptops and stationaries. Similar to a native app, the PWA has an icon for your home screen, a splash screen for loading stages and are already available and used every day. PWAs can already reach to many device’s resources through rising APIs. They already have support for multitouch, camera, gallery, etc.
Not bad for a homescreen icon that is merely a bookmark.
The idea of PWAs became alive ever since the dawn of apps and capacitive touchphones.
Websites at that time, were made to work on big desktop 22 inches, not on 4-inch phones. Zooming a website and squinting to read the text was a common practice with smartphones. (mind the double-tap text function). That’s why native apps were much more attractive. There was more freedom. Content became more concentrated and we became much more careful with screen estate. Until smartphones became a thing, there was no appeal to flex a website to a smaller space. This soon changed since consumers spend more time on their phones and content providers saw it profitable. Later, when the web became responsive, it even beat some native apps.

Apps became a thing soon after the iPhone was released in 2007. Steve at that keynote, announced three features: an iPod, a phone and a web browser in a single physical device. Amazing as it seemed at that time, those mentioned functions were introduced as “apps”. Their icons had rounded corners and resided on a home screen. They had their own icon that conveyed their function. They were also built to run on the iPhone specifically. The app environment at that time wasn’t open and that left enthusiasts wanting. There was no App Store yet because nobody was making them. The phone made enough steer in public, so everyone rushed to get one. Enthusiasts demanded the release of development tools so Apple, gladly did just that and announced Xcode and opened the App Store. The race began.
But unknowingly, with the introduction of “The Breakthrough Internet Device” new opportunities made way for web pages as well. Steve, at that time, actually did not intend to open app development doors. Some even say the apps would have been made only by Apple. There were so many unknowns back then, but one thing was sure: the way we use the web fundamentally changed. Folding content on websites is only one of the puzzle pieces. Since then we focused on concentrated information and removing unwanted functions. Information became available on the spot and the era of instant comunication began.
Here is a chronological view about concerning several events that affected web to develop and become compliant for many devices.

2007 — Steve Jobs labelled the iPhone as the breakthrough Internet Device. Safari, iPod and the phone feature announced. He talked of the first “usable” web browser on a mobile device.
2007 — Facebook launches their iOS native app
2008 — HTML5 first working draft. This enabled richer content viewed within the browser.
2008 — Opening of Apple App Store
2008 — W3C announced client based SQL storage
2008 — first Hybrid Apps — Native apps began to serve web content within an internal web view.
2009 — Google announces their Android marketplace — Also known as Google Play Store
2010 — About 3% of all global websites are visited from mobile platforms
2010 — Firefox starts on open web apps — apps could work offline
2010 — Apple releases iPad 1
2011 — Amazon opens their app store for their Kindle Fire and others like Blackberry
2011 — Facebook re-launches iPhone app and announces new iPad and Android apps — all of them use HTML5
2012 — Firefox marketplace and Firefox web runtime — allows installing OpenWebApps to Win, MAC, Android and Linux.
2013 — First working manifest for web apps and bookmarks released
2014 — About 30% of all global websites served on mobile platforms. [1]
2015 — PWA implementation — Service worker and app banners, push notification, background runtime, manifest files.
2017 — Google announced their own tools towards bringing PWA to life. Apparently, Google Chrome team was excited about it since their beginnings.
2017 — Number of new apps in Apple’s App Store started to decline. [3]
2018 — web apps are known for their abilities and Safari began to support web workers.
2018 — Windows 10 Redstone begins to support web apps.
2018 — Twitter has deprecated MAC OS app and now relying on the web app.
Our current system supports native apps, so there will be quite a few changes concerning our current technologies:
### App regulation
Nowadays when a fresh app is submitted to the app store, it goes through several reviews. This consists of reliability, performance and other compliance checks. Web apps, however, don’t have the same treatment. Because they are installed from the web (as simple as adding a bookmark or tapping a popup window) app store can be omitted completely.
Pinterest is one of the first examples. Because of large JS files and traffic overload, users had to wait as much as 32 seconds to be served the content. They have reduced their multi-megabyte JS logic to a couple hundred of kb [2]. The app started to function as expected. App developer will have to leverage analytics tools to improve quality.
### Discoverability
The store was considerably the place where apps get discovered. For PWAs this process is not the same. On smartphones, users have to visit a site 2 times, before it offers them a banner to install the app. This surprising threshold does its job well for most of the sites. But you don’t have to do it like that. You can always “install” it by adding its bookmarks on the home screen.
This means we will have to rely on other ways to discover apps unless of course they too get promoted in application stores.
### Online/Offline
PWAs work by bringing content from the internet to our screens. If there is no connection, there is no content. This notion became less true when regulators provided PWAs with more browser cache and more time to store the information. This means shorter disconnection will not harm the user experience.
### Security
Security when using PWA’s is similar to the websites. We already have strong tools to monitor and fix such problems. The web has been around for quite some time now and it would be surprising if no measures would be taken.
Google’s Lighthouse allows you to check whether your Website classifies as a PWA. There is a checklist, where you can check if all necessary is there to help you host a PWA. You can find more info about this automated tool here: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/
The tool simply checks if all necessary requirements are met, here is the checklist:

### Web browsers
PWAs can run cross-browser. This means users with different browsers like edge or chrome, view the same content. Apps on Windows computers will look and behave similarly as on Chrome browser on a Macintosh Computer. The difference lies mostly in browser configuration and hardware setting.
### Microsoft
Microsoft is crawling the web for PWAs and solving its app gap problem in their app store. Bing crawlers have already imported many apps to their store already. If you happen to have Windows Redstone, you can start using PWAs and get that native experience. Worry not, you still can enjoy those apps, just with a browser bar at the top of the app window. The experience however, is the same.
### Apple
Apple showed some hesitation with PWA support. They were one of the last to support web workers in their browser. They spend a lot of resources to bring Swift into schools and upbringing new developers. There is not much certainty where this will lead their initiatives.
### Google
Google, like Apple, will have to adapt to severe PWAs. Google Chrome Team seems very happy about it and already provides guidelines and clear instructions on building PWAs. PWAs will definitely come useful for their Android system on smartphones and Chromebooks.
### Development
Development can be done by merely web developers and content can be personalised up to the next degree. Besides that, some PWAs even look and feel native. There are articles on how to make your app feel native.
Installing an app is easy. Microsoft has them in their store already, and if you are running MS Windows 10 Redstone, you can already see them in action. https://www.windowscentral.com/twitter-pwa-windows10
Those are just some features that Microsoft and Google are leveraging today.
This change is great news for small companies since they don’t have to develop native apps, but rather rely on web developers to do that instead. Developers can leverage the evolved web tools to bring security, analytics and other functions under a single roof.
We can conclude that web pages with service workers are basically apps already. In the future, companies will slowly adopt the faster models of evolving their apps. Number of PWAs will grow faster and leverage cloud services.
### Current Application stores
Since Apple charges developers to publish their apps in the store, putting PWAs there would potentially hurt their app developers.
Same goes for the Google Play Store. But since all that may be true, developers will still be needed to develop apps that can not run from the browser.
### Current devices
The current feel here is that APIs will surface in the future to support HW functions like 3D touch, Active edge and others. For my personal use, I already store most of my files in the cloud and use cloud apps. Just because I migrate between devices so much.
In this article, I mentioned all in favour of web apps, but generally, there will always be the need to make native apps as well. There are still so many things PWAs can not do and probably never will.
