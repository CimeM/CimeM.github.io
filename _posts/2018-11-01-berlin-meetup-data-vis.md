This week I have visited a data science meetup in Berlin at Datawrapper. The meetup was a mixture of a book club and a branch of data science where the theme was about a book: "[Storytelling with data](https://www.amazon.com/Storytelling-Data-Visualization-Business-Professionals-ebook/dp/B016DHQSM2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1541458749&sr=8-1&keywords=storytelling+with+data)" written by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic.

We dove deep into data visualization where the red line of the meetup was about presenting the information in a way that it has the right impact and leads to the right outcome. Hence the storytelling part.

The author of the book explains how we can emphasize our key points in our presentation and make a better impact by leading our listeners through the narrative. Presenting as a story has many benefits over a long and tedious email report.

Thanks to Datawrapper and Lisa Charlotte Rost for hosting the meetup! Check out her blog and the company she is involved in [Datawrapper](https://www.blog.datawrapper.de/).
