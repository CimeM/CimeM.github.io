If you have a computer it's obvious you store your birthday photos, videos and project files on the disk drive. If your drive would get erased, you would probably regret not having a copy of it. All those memories of you wearing those funny sox would be lost forever. All those things represent everything we did over time, where we've been and what we wore. It is valuable to us, not just personally, but professionally as well. For some their computer, their phone is where they store all that information, losing it would spell a catastrophe. It did happen to me and I recovered from it using data clouds.

I was messing with a project, which required me to load the virtual image to the SDcard. The card had to be erased and since I had trouble with my Macintosh, I tried with Linux. Booted from a USB stick it promised to be quick indeed. Once G-Parted was opened, I glanced at Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory proposing to Amy. The confirmation box appeared, pressed enter not even reading the text, quickly returning my attention to Amy.

I glanced at my computer, the success message appeared. Clicked "OK". And as I was turning to the tv I repeated the message in my head, it read: "All operations successfully completed! ... free space: 250GB".
Looking at TV again. Wait! what? I froze. My SD has 250GB? No way! It would have been much more expensive.

My computer was blank as the wall behind it.

I booted the computer without the key and I just stared at the blank screen for a minute. Everything was gone. Photos, videos, projects, masters degree, illustrations.... Gone in a spiral of the fast digital blackout. It's like someone just turned off the tv. I kept staring there but had to realise it was really off.
I buried my face in my hands. And just stopped the rush all the screens put me into.

I slowly realised what an idiot I was. But luckily, I have all the important things on the cloud. You see, every time I saved something on my drive, it got picked up and saved in the cloud. I have Evernote, Dropbox, Google drive and Git full of my projects. The relief slowly started to wash the nervousness away. I put my laptop through installation and fell in bed.

Next morning I set in front of the screen again. I turned it on and realised how fast fresh the OS really felt. It was not laggy and actually really responsive. The new stock wallpaper introduced the out-of-the-store feeling again. I was not opening my laptop. It was a curtain opening to a new show. A new chapter. I felt like I was sitting in the cinema and the reflectors just dimmed and the show started to fill my ears with jazz and dancers appeared in front. I was happy for my recent discovery, but still sobering up form the idiotic thing that happened. Gigs from the cloud clogged the internet bandwidth for a few hours. At 10 everything was fine again. Finally, relief.

Besides from the fresh feeling, this also meant a new start. Conscious data organization became the new normal. Since I was already used to clouds, I needed to seal the promise. From here on out, data belongs to the cloud!

At the end, I lost a few photos, some website backups and a few illustrations. Nothing too dramatical. Everything else was already waiting for me on my drive.
