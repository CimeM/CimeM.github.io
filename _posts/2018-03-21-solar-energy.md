If you’re like me, you probably don’t know how much power does your fridge use. For many people doesn’t matter because the consumption is so modest, that it’s counted in cents. Comparing it to tens or hundreds of dollars spent for fuel to run our car. A small fish in a big pond you may say. Well, not quite..

While the costs may seem low it doesn’t mean they are for you. In the long run, those expenses actually burn a lot more than what you think. Not only for persistently beating up your paycheck, but also for our carbon footprint. Power plants hum 24/7 to power the whole city. Large smog clouds pollute our sky as tons of coal is being burned in hot furnaces by the minute. In return, we can watch our TVs, keep our food cold and watch cats online.

This is why it’s important to know how much electricity our home is consuming. Every kW/h saved at home is the same one saved many fold. Due to burning in power plants, transporting the energy over the grid and providing the fuel for the plant.

Measuring your consumption for the entire home is easy. Just open your power cabinet (where the fuses are). There you will find your power meter. And you can probably see how much you are spending at the moment.

Now, you need to understand your consumption changes by the time of the day, the season and even year. Power consumption often reflects our habits, because at winter we often stay in our heated apartments where it’s warm and comfortable, watching seasons of Game of Thrones or True Blood and drinking tea, heated by our electric stove. In summer we spend our time outdoors burning bonfires and looking at stars at nights. At the same time, we don’t have to heat up our home in summer, we cool it down, using AC.

It’s not bad if we use electricity, however, its wrong if we use it carelessly. Your devices burn electricity and you will save money if you make conscious decisions on which ones to buy and how to use them, you will save money and help with reducing the carbon footprint. Usually, economical devices cost more, but that can be a returning investment if you know how much you will save using it in the long run.

Measuring the damage
If you want to measure appliance consumption, just look it up in the specs sheet that came in the box. The other way is to hook power meters between the wall and power cable. This way you can measure exact consumption by the time period. Knowing the local price of utilities, you can calculate your burning price.

Spending indicators
One way to save energy and to remind yourself towards saving is to install power meters that show you how much you are spending in terms of money. Many experts have installed this indicators int peoples living room to remind them to turn off appliances when the energy was more expensive. And run their washing machines when it was not.

The future is showing us savings will be automated
If you haven’t lived under a rock in the past few years, there is a chance you’ve heard about smart house devices. Basically, devices that control your home and you can control them using your smartphone. You can plug them between the wall socket and your appliance and turn it on or off. This is how many future proof homes save money on lighting. Their washing machines and other devices. Those same people got artificial systems that run their homes and save them money.
