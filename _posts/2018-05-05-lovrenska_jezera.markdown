Lovrenška lakes are a paradise to those who are looking for preserved natural wonders in Slovenia. At the end of April, my friends and I packed the car and left to see them. In the middle of Pohorje between Rogla and Ribiško Pohorje, several lakes fill the area of 54 acres. Accumulated by meteor waters only and surrounded by waste - sized bushes. The area is a swamp, so there are wooden trails built to and around the landmarks.

Rogla is an excellent retreat that packs up a resort for winter activities. The village lays 1500 m above sea level and counted only one inhabitant in 2005. The road took us just further into the forest. 

We parked our red Opel at a cabin and continued by foot. Spring has melted away winter’s attractions and filling a small lake and a multitude of water streams. Our attention almost immediately diverted to small patches of snow that became our playground for a while.

We knew we made it early in the season, but we had no idea that snow will be making our hike a little harder. It was weak enough to break under our weight and we often had to catch our balance once that happened, and sometimes pull our legs out, since small water streams could fill our shoes with refreshing feels we did not want at that point.

The coniferous forest had its ways with swamps and if it hadn’t been for trail marcations, we would probably lose our way. We learned how horses delicately respond from rider’s tilt on their back from a local that teaches new riders. A spring-loaded wooden device would simulate the horse response and actually got him a gold medal for innovation and approach in Austria just a few years ago.

The grass revealed small passages mice and other creatures built under the white cover to find food and survival shelter during the season. Trees had seen better seasons. Their skin was peeling and branches seemed like they dried up. 

The hour and a half long trail just started to level down when we saw the top of the watchtower. Just at the same time snow and swampy grounds were replaced with wooden pathways and tall trees with waist tall shrubs.

At first glance, the path led to a curve so we could not see where it went. The hedge made it seem like it wonders into the field like a maze where you could get lost easily. If it wasn’t for the tower, that would probably be the scenario for us. There are 11 to 22 small lakes in a 54-acre field, 1533 meters above sea level.

We learned that the place attracts visitors all year around. Many come here by recommendations and site seeing, but often learn to ride horses and stay in small and cosy cabins. It is a getaway like no other. Its hard to escape from the grid, but once we did, we wanted to prolong the necessary return to the city. The rain finally gave us enough motivation to leave the place.
