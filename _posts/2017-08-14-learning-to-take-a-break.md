The bullshit we are digesting when facing a trial and not coming up with anything is just the matter of priorities. It is important to see the bigger picture. Only then we are able to come up with great things. It’s the basis for creativity. You have to have a greater goal to do the small things that will lead you to it.

So there I was in front of a computer. I was staring at the blinking cursor marking may position on a blank page. I could not come up with anything. My messy apartment was too dark and despite the lonely calm feeling of being on my own, I could not come up with words. It’s like you do everything to get some rest and you just can’t throw the ball. Seems like mission impossible.

That is the point where I usually did open some incognito procrastination and just faded away. It was like I sat on a fun rollercoaster of cat videos and interesting washing machines going crazy. I was hallucinating of laughter and I slowly closed my creativity. Only to wake up a few hours later media still echoing in the background slowly fading away as the blank page was still staring at me as if it’s a dog still expecting a treat. I gasped and become instantly sorry for myself. I even became angry because I knew if I sit there for another hour I’m going to go crazy.

I had to take a break. I went out and for a run to fill myself with positive energy and wash away the darkness from my mind. I am still amazed how well this works. Back to the computer.

Still wet from the shower I begin afresh. The things happened before are downing on me every time I look at the clock. I had little time and this was it. I wrote one true sentence, as I was Hemmingway, and drifted into what is was working on before.

I did my part and it was great. I wrote some hefty things, some of which I even think today. They keep returning to me and I stand a little taller because of them.

At the end of the day, I learned there was more to work. Taking time off also takes part in being productive. It is a lesson that thought me the most. Combined with the feeling that I don’t have to finish up today — that i can divide work into small chunks keeps me sayin’: “you won today but your days are numbered!”.

Nowadays I listen to what my body is saying and sometimes I’m not proud of acids I put myself through but being a workaholic is just what runs my juices. Seeing a project come to realisation gives me goosebumps, even just for thinking about it. And at the end, i think it’s totally worth it. I was blind but now I see. Because not only I began to finish projects before due date but also to become aware how to play my cards with myself.
